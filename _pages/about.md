I’m Sajratul Yakin Rubaiat, a **PhD student** at the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/) specializing in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **database systems**. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and database engineering, where I explore innovative ways to apply LLMs in fields requiring **real-time information**, such as **journalism** and **biomedical research**. I am supervised by [Dr. Hasan Jamil](https://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/cs/our-people/faculty/hasan-jamil) and work in the **SmartDatabase Lab**, where we’re developing advanced database solutions driven by AI.

Previously, I worked as a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/) and [Practice by Numbers](https://www.practicenumbers.com/), where I led projects focused on **data synchronization**, **campaign automation**, security enhancements, and UI/UX improvements, optimizing systems for **performance and reliability** across global teams. My experience also includes developing **machine learning solutions** for early diagnosis in medical applications, such as pneumonia detection through X-ray analysis and diabetes prediction as part of my undergraduate research.

Additionally, I have experience in **competitive programming**, having participated in the ACM ICPC, which sharpened my problem-solving skills. I’m an avid learner with strong foundations in **Python**, **C++**, and **Java**, along with proficiency in frameworks like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Django** and **React**. When I’m not immersed in research or coding, I enjoy cooking, exploring new cuisines, and discovering scenic spots around Idaho.
